Matplotlib graph not opening

My Jupyter setting ID: jupyter.runStartupCommands

When I click "edit settings.json" this opens:

{
    "python.languageServer": "Pylance",
    "workbench.editorAssociations": [
        {
            "viewType": "jupyter.notebook.ipynb",
            "filenamePattern": "*.ipynb"
        }
    ],
    "jupyter.runStartupCommands": "
    
    "
}

Please tell how to fix the issue (see title).
Thank you in advance.
